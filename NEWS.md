# radiant.data 0.9.6.1

## Major changes

* Using [`shinyFiles`](https://github.com/thomasp85/shinyFiles) to provide convenient access to data located on a server
* Revert from `svg` to `png` for plots in `_Report > Rmd_ and _Report > R_. `svg` scatter plots with many point get to big for practical use on servers that have to transfer images to a local browser

## Minor changes

* Removed depency on `methods` package

# radiant.data 0.9.5.3

* Fix smart comma's in data descriptions
* Search and replace `desc(n)` in reports and replace by `desc(n_obs)`
* Revert to storing the r_data environment as a list on stop to avoid reference problems (@josh1400)
* Fix for plot type in _Data > Pivot_ in older state files (@josh1400)
* Used all declared imports (CRAN)

# radiant.data 0.9.5.0

* Fix for `radiant.data::explore` when variable names contain an underscore 
* Fix for `find_gdrive` when drive is not being synched
* Fixes in _Report > Rmd_ and _Report > R_ to accomodate for pandoc > 2 

# radiant.data 0.9.4.6

* Don't update a reactive binding for an object if the binding already exists. See issue  https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/2065
* Fix to accomodate changes in `deparse` in R 3.5
* Fix for saving data in _Data > Manage_ and generating the relevant R-code

# radiant.data 0.9.3.5

## Minor changes

* Use `dev = "svg"` for plots in _Report > Rmd_ and _Report > R_

# radiant.data 0.9.3.4

## Minor changes

* Add argument to `dtab.data.frame` to format specified columns as a percentage

## Bug fixes

* Round to the specified number of decimal places even if input if not of type integer (e.g., 2.0)

# radiant.data 0.9.3.3

## Major changes

* When using radiant with Rstudio Viewer or in an Rstudio Window, loading and saving data through _Data > Manage_ generates R-code the user can add to _Report > Rmd_ or _Report > R_. Clicking the `Show R-code` checkbox displays the R-code used to load or save the current dataset
* Various changes to the code to accomodate the use of `shiny::makeReactiveBinding`. The advantage is that the code generated for _Report > Rmd_ and _Report > R_ will no longer have to use a list (`r_data`) to store and access data. This means that code generated and used in the Radiant browser interface will be directly usable without the browser interface as well
* Removed `loadr`, `saver`, `load_csv`, `loadcsv_url`, `loadrds_url`, and `make_funs` functions as they are no longer needed
* Deprecated `mean_rm`, `median_rm`, `min_rm`, `max_rm, `sd_rm`, `var_rm, and `sum_rm` functions as they are no longer needed 

## Minor changes

* Added `load_clip` and `save_clip` to load and save data to the clipboard on Windows and macOS
* Improved auto completion in _Report > Rmd_ and _Report > R_
* Maintain, store, and clean the settings of the interactive table in _Data > View_
* Address closing Rstudio Window issue (https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/2033)

# radiant.data 0.9.2.3

## Major changes

* _Report > Rmd_ and _Report > R_ will now be evaluated the `r_data` environment. This means that the return value from `ls()` will be much cleaner

## Minor changes

* Add option to load files with extension .rdata or .tsv using `loadr` which add that data to the Datasets dropdown
* `visualize` will default to a scatter plot if `xvar` and `yvar` are specified but no plot `type` is provided in the function call
* Improvements to `read_files` function to interactively generate R-code (or Rmarkdown code-chunks) to read files in various format (e.g., SQLite, rds, csv, xlsx, css, jpg, etc.). Supports relative paths and uses `find_dropbox()` and `find_gdrive()` when applicable

# radiant.data 0.9.2.2

## Minor changes

* Require `shinyAce` 0.3.0
* Export `read_files` function to interactively generate R-code or Rmarkdown code-chunks to read files in various format (e.g., SQLite, rds, csv, xlsx, css, jpg, etc.). Supports relative paths and uses `find_dropbox()` and `find_gdrive()` when applicable

# radiant.data 0.9.2.0

## Minor changes

* Addins option to start app in Rstudio window
* Upload and download data using the Rstudio file browser. Allows using relative paths to files (e.g., data or images inside an Rstudio project)

## Minor changes

* Changed license for help files and images for radiant.data to [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode)

# radiant.data 0.9.0.15

## Minor changes

* Option to set number of decimals to show in _Data > View_ 
* Improved number formatting in interactive tables in _Data > View_, _Data > Pivot_, and _Data > Explore_

* _Data > Transform_ will leave variables selected, unless switching to `Create` or `Spread`
* Switch focus to editor in _Report > Rmd_ and _Report > R_ when no other input has focus

## Bug fixes

* Add information about the first level when plotting a bar chart with a categorical variable on the Y-axis (e.g., mean(buyer {yes}))

## Bug fixes 

* Cleanup now also occurs when the stop button is used in Rstudio to close the app
* Fix to include `DiagrammeR` based plots in Rmarkdown reports

# radiant.data 0.9.0.0

## Major changes

* If Rstudio project is used _Report > Rmd_ and _Report > R_ will use the project directory as base. This allows users to use relative paths and making it easier to share (reproducible) code
* Specify options in .Rprofile for upload memory limit and running _Report > Rmd_ on server

* _Report > Rmd_ Read button to generate code to load various types of files in report (e.g., jpg, png, md, Rmd, R). If Radiant was started from an Rstudio project, the file paths used will be relative to the project root. Paths to files synced to local Dropbox or Google Drive folder will use the `find_dropbox` and `find_gdrive` functions to enhances reproducibility.
* _Report > Rmd_ Load Report button can be used to load Rmarkdown file in the editor. It will also extract the source code from Notebook and HTML files with embedded Rmarkdown
